_“Your Process is Wrong”_ is code for *“You don’t do things like other people do things.”*

Your process can always be improved.

You can always learn new techniques, new flows, new ways to engage. You can learn from others and/or you can discover on your own.

What you don’t need to think about is how your process is wrong. _“Your process is wrong” ends ideas._ It turns off the whole thing. It’s not fun -- Even if it’s presented as constructive feedback.

You aren’t everyone else, you can’t build like everyone else. At a certain point, you will just accept yourself, accept how you build, how you think. And that will be a great day for you as a builder.
